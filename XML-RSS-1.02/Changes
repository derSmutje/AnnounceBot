Revision history for Perl extension XML::RSS.

1.02 - Mon Feb 20 15:34:21 2003
        * fixed bug in encode().  encode() did not respect CDATA
        sections and would mangle them when encountered.  now behaves
        properly (we hope) even when CDATA and #PCDATA are mixed
        together liberally

1.01 - Mon Feb  3 15:46:25 2003
	* fixed bug with handle_char().  i (brian d foy) mis-diagnosed a
	previous bug and broke handle_char() when what I should have done
	was initialise the object for each call to parse*()

	* if you have version 1.0, you should upgrade to this version, 1.01

1.00 - Fri Jan 31 11:26:41 2003
	* the as_string method now encodes special characters. valid output!
	* a new "Auto Add" feature can add modules for namespaces found
	while parsing (off by default)
	* can output RSS 2.0, but not parse it yet
	* this is the last major release in this track.  we are going to
	completely rewrite XML::RSS as something more extendable.

0.98_05 - Mon Jan 27 15:54:32 2003
	* The auto add_feature is not controlled by the $AUTO_ADD variable
	and is off by default
	* removed the distribution tests now that it is ready to distribute

0.98_04 - Fri Jan 17 20:00:29 2003
	* the parse and parsefile routines now automatically add non-
	standard namespace to the modules list

0.98_03 - Fri Jan 17 19:22:20 2003
       * changed the handle_char() routine to replace data rather than
       append to existing data.  this takes care of the doubling problem
       in the last issue.
 
       * set the RSS 2.0 namespace in the _initializer routine
 
       * all tests now pass.  if this works for people, it could turn into
       a release candidate

0.98_02 - Fri Jan 17 19:15:45 2003
	* changed the handle_char() routine to replace data rather than
	append to existing data.  this takes care of the doubling problem
	in the last issue.

	* set the RSS 2.0 namespace in the _initializer routine

	* all tests now pass.  if this works for people, it could turn into
	a release candidate

0.98_02 - Fri Jan 17 15:47:29 2003
	* added initial RSS 2.0 support
	* first fix to properly encode special characters in output
	* need to fix feature to add namespace (tests are TO DO)

0.1  Wed Jul  7 16:22:25 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19
0.2  Sat Jul 24 21:12:22 EDT 1999

0.4 - removed extraneous print
    - added stuff in examples/rss2html.pl
0.5 - fixed handle_char method which croaked on cdata
      that contained entities. Reported by 
      Wojciech Zwiefka <wojtekz@cnt.pl>
    - prettied up the output from rss2html.pl. It's
      now more suitable for including news feeds on
      a Web site. Also added ability to give local
      filename or http URL.
0.6 - numerous minor bug fixes
    - it no longer checks for size as specified by Netscape's RSS spec
      unless otherwise specified
0.7 Wed Oct 20 22:41:05 EDT 1999
    -parameters were not getting set unless the strict parameter was set 
    -fixed spelling for managingEditor and webMaster

0.96 Sat Mar 17 17:21:27 EST 2001
	-fixed RSS 0.91 output. When the source file that is parsed was
         1.0, it did not properly translate all of the dc elements to
         0.91 channel elements.
0.97 Wed Mar 21 03:13:29 EST 2001
	-added support for the Taxonomy module (taxo). It only works
         inside the channel or item elements and only supports one
         form of the module syntax. See the XML::RSS documentation
         for examples.

0.98 Tue Nov 12 05:45:36 CST 2002
	- module taken over by brian d foy <bdfoy@cpan.org>

	usual suspects)
	- fixed ommission of encoding with version 0.9 output
